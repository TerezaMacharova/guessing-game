## Name
Guessing Game

## Description
This application is written in the programming language python. Itâ€™s a guessing game where the user thinks of an animal and the computer is trying to guess it. If the computer is unable to guess the animal correctly  the user wins and is asked to teach the computer the new animal. If the computer guesses it correctly, the user loses.

## Installation
I have used python version 3.6 and Microsoft Visual Studio. It also uses libraries, the one that does not come in python standart library is pyspellchecker, so it's necessary to install this one (using pip install pyspellchecker).

## Usage
This application is a simple guessing game, where the user is thinking of an animal and the computer is trying to guess it.
